Deep Learning Model - Convolution Neural Network Model to predict flower categories:

Goal is to develop a convolution neural network (CNN) model to predict flower categories.

The dataset contains images of flowers belonging to 17 different categories and the images were acquired by searching the web and taking pictures. There are 80 images for each category. 

Dataset was partitioned into training and validation sets by randomly picking data records and VGG16 model was developed to predict the flower category.
